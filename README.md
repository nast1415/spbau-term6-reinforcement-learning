### Exercise 4

Folder `plots` contains plots illustrated results of the sarsa and q learning algorithms.

File `new_grid_modification.py` contais different implementations of the lion and cow grid (according to each task ang algorithm).

File `task4_q_sarsa.py` contains implementations of sarsa and q learning algorithms (on grids with different number of cows).

File `task4_mc_dp.py` contains implementations of dp value iteration and on policy first visit MC control algorithms (on grids with different number of cows).
