File `new_grid_modification.py` contains different modifications of lion and cow grid for exercises 4 and 5.

File `task5_1.py` contains DYNA-Q and DYNA-Q+ with prioritized sweeping algorithms implementation applying to 10x10 grid with two cows.

File `task5_2.py` contains DYNA-Q and DYNA-Q+ with prioritized sweeping algorithms implementation applying to 10x10 stochastic grid (with 70% chance of success) with two cows.
