### Repository for RL homeworks (SPBAU - 6 term)

Each task is placed in its own branch:
* `hw2` — lion and cow grid; policy iteration; value iteration
* `hw3` — blackjack game and on-policy first visit MC control algorithm
* `hw4` — lion and cow grid modification; SARSA and Q learning; MC and DP implementations
* `hw5` — lion and cow grid (with two cows), Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+ with prioritized sweeping algorithms implementation, stochastic lion cow domain
* `hw6` — applying SARSA with tile coding to the mountain car domain from OpenAI gym
